## About Me
Hi, I'm Jackie Nguyen! I'm currently a grade 11 student at Port Credit Secondary School enrolled in the Sci-Tech program

## My Project
#### Remote Control Car
For my Final Project in TEJ3MR-1-Computer Engineering Technology, me and my partner Abdulhady decided to build a Rc car that can avoid obstacles, follow lines so there isn't a need to drive it with the remote, and has a mini screen attached to use as a face.
