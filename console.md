## Welcome to Our Robot Car Project
We're Jackie and Abdulhady. This project started with an idea to design and build a rc car that has unique futures and that is different from others. Here's the journey of how we made it happen!

## Key Features of Our Robot Car
Our rc car is packed with features like:
- Obstacle Avoidance
- Line Following
- Facial Expressions (using RGB LEDs)
- Bluetooth Remote Control Compatibility (Still figuring it out)

## Components Used in The Build
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Motor Driver Board
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motors
- RGB LEDs
- Li-Ion Battery Pack
- Wheels and Chassis

## Process of Building The car
From assembling the chassis to programming the sensors, every step was a challenge. This project helped us learn about

Writing code to program the Raspberry Pi
Testing and debugging hardware and software

## See It in Action
Check out our rc car in action! Whether it's avoiding obstacles, following a line, or showing off its cool expressions, this car never fails to impress.

## Conclusion
This project was more than just building a robot car, it was a journey of creativity, learning, and teamwork. From building the car  to programming and troubleshooting, we gained valuable skills and fun unforgettable experiences.
